## Creating the .env files

In order to connect to the databases used in this repository (nc_news and nc_news_test), set up 2 files:
.env.development
.env.test

These files should assign PGDATABASE to the correct database (for an example look in .env-example), database_name_here should be nc_news for .env.development and nc_news_test for .env.test
